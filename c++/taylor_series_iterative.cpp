/*
The taylor series formula is the representation of any function as an infinite sum of terms.   These terms are calculated from
the values of the functionâ€™s derivatives at a single point. This concept is formulated by Scottish mathematician
James Gregory, but formally introduced by English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715.
