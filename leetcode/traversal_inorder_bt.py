'''
In inorder traversal, root node is visited in between itâ€™s left and right child.
In this type of traversal, first entry is the leftmost node present in the the tree, last entry is
the rightmost node present in the the tree, and root node cannot be identified.

process for inorder:
1) visit the left subtree of root
2) visit the root
3) visit the right subtree of root
